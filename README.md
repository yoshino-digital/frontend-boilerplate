# Yoshino Boilerplate

This is a bare bone package to kickstart your project with the Yoshino Ui Core library. Make sure you read the [docs](https://yoshino.digital/ui-core/docs/) to learn how to use the components and how to customize your project.

## Setup

To start a new project, you need to install node.js on your computer. After that, with just a single command, all other files are downloaded, a local webserver starts and greets you with the index page. **We assume you are using a Mac.** Just follow these steps:

1. Launch Terminal.app
2. Letâ€™s go. First install [homebrew](http://brew.sh). Type: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
3. Now you have homebrew on your mac. Installing node.js is easy now. Type: `brew install node`
4. Almost done. Last step, type: `npm install`
5. After the install process, a new browser window should open and display the index page. Hooray!
