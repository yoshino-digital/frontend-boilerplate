# Yoshino Boilerplate

This is a bare bone package to kickstart your project with the Yoshino Ui Core library. Make sure you read the [docs](https://yoshino-digital.github.io/ui-core/) to learn how to use the components and how to customize your project.

## Setup

To start a new project, you need to install some files on your computer. **We assume you are using a Mac.** Follow these steps:

1. Launch _Terminal.app_.
2. First install [homebrew](http://brew.sh). Type: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
3. Now you have _homebrew_ on your Mac. To install [node.js](http://nodejs.org), type: `brew install node`.
4. Choose or create a folder where you wish to copy the Yoshino Boilerplate files to. Please notice: the boilerplate will create it’s own main directory, called „yoshino-frontend-boilerplate“.
5. Back to the _Terminal_, type: `cd `, then drag your folder into the _Terminal_ window. You will read something like `cd /Users/yourUserName/yourFolder`. Hit the enter key.
6. Now, copy the Yoshino Boilerplate to your computer. Type: `git clone https://github.com/yoshino-digital/frontend-boilerplate`.
7. To download the [Yoshino Ui Core](https://github.com/yoshino-digital/ui-core) and some other dependencies for the _Boilerplate_, type `npm install`.
8. After the install process, a new browser window should open and display the index page. Hooray!
